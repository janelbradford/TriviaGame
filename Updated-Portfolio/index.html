            <p>My name is Janel Bradford, and I am so happy to finally be in this coding class. I currently work full
                time as an
                LVN at the Department of Veterans Affairs. I genuinely love helping people and giving back to Veterans
                is such a joy. I was born in Southern California, on George Air Force Base in a small town called
                Victorvile.

                I have 2 daughters; Heavyn and Faith - (18, and 12). I know I dont look like I have a eighteen year old,
                but I do :). My oldest is currently attending Sacramento State University and wants to be an English
                Teacher.</p>

            <p>On my spare time, I like to be near the water, relaxing and hanging out with my friends. I enjoy learning
                new things and was first interested in coding when I originally saw DOS.
                I use it at my current
                job.</p>

            <p>A fun fact about me is that I'm a girly girl and I'm deathly afraid of bugs and spiders.</p>
